HomePage test - when we click on the home tab from any other page, it leads us to the home page, which is empty for now. 

Login page test - When we click on the login page from any other page, it leads us to the login page. When we type in a password that is less than 8 characters long, it creates an error; when we click login after entering our credentials it brings us to a module not found error page (because it is not finished yet - database not connected yet)

Register page test - When we click on the register page from any other page, it leads us to the register page. If we try to register with an invalid email or a password that is less than 8 characters or input a different password when we have to confirm it, it tells us an error. If we try to sign up without inputting anything, it tells us that we have to input the mandatory fields. If we click register, it keeps our first name, last name, username and email saved but empties out the password, doesn't bring us anywhere.
