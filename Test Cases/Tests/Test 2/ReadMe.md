Just for frontend testing - backend/database is not connected to these tests

forgot password page -  when password is invalid it notifies us. when we click confirm, nothing happens

login page - when we click login, nothing happens. when we click register, nothing happens. when we click login with valid user and pass, nothing happens. when we click login with invalid user or pass, it notifies us. when we click login with password less than 8 characters, it notifies us.

reset password page - when we click confirm with a valid password, nothing happens (since backend & database isn't connected). When we click confirm with less than an 8 character password, it notifies us.
