We tested the new frontend designs for the forgotPassword page, login page, register page, and reset password page. The functions are same
as before. They add a little design for the layout and UI, but it seems like expanding through the webpage and not having a visually
comfortable size. While we were trying to run the app.py file, there were some errors
occuring(AttributeError).
