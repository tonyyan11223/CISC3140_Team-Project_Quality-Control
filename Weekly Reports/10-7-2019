What has your team accomplished in the past week? 
We wrote a draft of the test cases to be tested once the website is up, based on the designs that we received from the product team. 

What should be tackled for the upcoming week? 
We will continue to plan the test cases once we receive the rest of the designs from the product team. We will test out the front 
end error-checking on the register page at this time. 

Will scheduling be affected? Are you waiting on another team for any features to finish? 
According to the front end team, the only thing that still needs to be fixed in the register page is the header. So, we will be 
waiting for the frontend team to fix that and finish other each features so that we can test them and all of the test cases that 
we planned based on the designs.
