How is your team breaking down work, what should be tackled for the upcoming week? 
We will begin learning or brushing up on the languages that the other teams are using. The frontend team will be using 
HTML/CSS, the backend team will be using Python and the database team will be using SQL. In order for us to check and 
do tests on the website and each function of the website, we will need to know each language to make sure we know what 
needs to happen and what actually happens in comparison. Since there are 6 members on the quality control team, we will 
break down our team into groups of two, each with a designate language that they have to focus on. Two people on our 
team will learn HTML/CSS, two will learn Python and two will learn SQL.

Would your team prefer other teams to contact a representative of your team or all team members? 
We prefer that other teams contact all of our team members so that we are all on the same page and understand what 
was done by the other teams and what needs to be done by our team. We also prefer being contacted as a group because 
if our representative is not available to respond, the rest of our team can give an answer to the other team so that 
we are not wasting time by waiting on others to answer questions.

What has your team accomplished in the past week? 
We began looking for videos and other resources that will teach us how to understand each language and each part of 
the project. We were also waiting for quality control to send us designs of specific pages for our website.
