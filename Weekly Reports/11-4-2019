What has your team accomplished in the past week? 
We tested the progress of the website. So far we have the basics of the home – just a plain page with a header link area, 
where we can click on home, login or register. Each page is redirected to the correct page. On the login page we are not able 
to login yet since it is not connected to a database, however it does tell us when our password does not reach the correct 
character limit. On the register page, although it does not allow us to register yet, it tells us if our email is in an incorrect 
format, or if our passwords don’t match or if our password is less than 8 characters long. When we try to press register, it just 
refreshes the page but keeps our first and last name, our email and our user name. If we try to register with an empty field, it 
lets us know and prevents us from continuing. 

Will scheduling be affected? Are you waiting on another team for any features to finish? 
We are waiting for other teams to let us know what work they have completed and what we can start testing.
