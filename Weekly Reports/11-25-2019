What has your team accomplished in the past week? 
"While we were trying to run the app.py file, there were some errorsoccuring(AttributeError)."  <---One of the Last Week process
We communicated with other teams, and the error was because we don't have the database in our local. As we tested through the week, 
the error is still there. We are waiting for the database team to give us the database.

Will scheduling be affected? Are you waiting on another team for any features to finish? 
We are waiting for the database team to provide us the database in order to access all functions other teams created.
