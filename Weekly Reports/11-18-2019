What has your team accomplished in the past week? 
We tested the new frontend designs for the forgotPassword page, login page, register page, and reset password page. The functions are same
as before. They add a little design for the layout and UI, but it seems like expanding through the webpage and not having a visually
comfortable size. We will communicate with other teams for the layout. While we were trying to run the app.py file, there were some errors
occuring(AttributeError). We will communicate with other teams about this and also our team member were studying python also, so we will
also check into the code to find the problem.

Will scheduling be affected? Are you waiting on another team for any features to finish? 
We are waiting for other teams to let us know what work they have completed and what we can start testing. At the same time, we will check
the error of the app.py file.
