What has your team accomplished in the past week? 
Since there isnâ€™t much being done due to the holidays, we are brushing up on our skills and learning code
	
What should be tackled for the upcoming week? 
We are waiting for the product team to upload their final designs. Once they send us their final designs we will write the test cases.

Will scheduling be affected? Are you waiting on another team for any features to finish? 
We are waiting for other teams to make some progress that we can test.
