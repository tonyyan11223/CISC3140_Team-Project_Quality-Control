What has your team accomplished in the past week? 
We found videos and gathered other resources based on each team language. This will help us later test the actual 
features of the site, making sure each feature works the way that it is supposed to work. We also received some prototype 
designs from the product team of layouts for specific web pages on our website. By looking at these prototype designs, 
our team can make sure that all the mandatory specifications that the whole group decided on is incorporated in the design 
and we can tell the product team what else is missing from each page (if anything).

What should be tackled for the upcoming week? 
We will begin planning the test cases based on the designs that we received from the product team. We will make a list of 
what needs to be tested â€“ each specific function, each button, different texts that we will try inputting into the text fields, 
etc. We will continue to plan the test cases as we receive each design from the product team. 

Will scheduling be affected? Are you waiting on another team for any features to finish? 
After we plan out the test cases based on the designs sent to us so far, we will be waiting for the product team to finish 
the rest of the designs for any other pages, and any changes they have made to the first batch of designs that we had issues 
with (if any). We will also be waiting for the frontend team to actually start testing out each feature and all of the test 
cases that we planned based on the designs.
