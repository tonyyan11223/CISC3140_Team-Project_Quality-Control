What has your team accomplished in the past week? 
We tested the progress of the website. The frontend team has made it clear for the backend team that they are still working on 
their templates and that backend shouldn’t add code to it unless frontend is finished. They uploaded the login page, reset password 
page and forgot password page. We tested out whether it does the basics that a frontend page should do. The forgot password page 
notifies us when the password is invalid and when we click confirm, nothing happens. The login page nothing happens when we click 
login, when we click register (because we don’t have an account) or when we click login with valid user and pass. When we click 
login with an invalid username or password (empty fields) or when we click login with a password that is less than 8 characters, 
it notifies us. The reset password page notifies us when we click confirm with a password that is less than 8 characters. When we 
click confirm with a valid password, nothing happens (since backend & database isn't connected). 

Will scheduling be affected? Are you waiting on another team for any features to finish? 
We are waiting for other teams to let us know what work they have completed and what we can start testing.
