What has your team accomplished in the past week? 
Since frontend team has supplied us with the login section we have begun testing, researching how to conduct testcases in python and flask. 

What should be tackled for the upcoming week? 
We will continue to plan the test cases concerning the designs from the product team. We will finish testing out the front 
end login section.

Will scheduling be affected? Are you waiting on another team for any features to finish? 
According to the front end team, the only thing that still needs to be fixed in the register page is the header. So, we will be 
waiting for the frontend team to fix that and finish other each features so that we can test them and all of the test cases that 
we planned based on the designs.
